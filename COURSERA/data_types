there are few premetive data types in python

1. Integer -> int (100)
2. Floating point numbers -> float (23.45)
3. String -> str ("abc" or 'abc' or "Amit Paul")
4. Boolean -> bool (True or False)

there are data structures pre defined in python 

1. Lists -> list -> ordered sequence of objects -> [12, "abc", 23.45] -> can be modified
2. Tuples -> tup -> ordered immutable sequence of objects -> (12, "abc", 23.45) -> can't be modified
3. Dictionaries -> dict -> unordered keys : valued pairs -> {"name" : "amit", "key" : "values"}
4. Sets -> set -> unordered collections of unique objects -> ("a", "b")

there's no boundary to declare data types of any variable, python will automatically understand which data type is assigned
to a variable and accordingly assign that particular data type.

We can also reassign values in the variable with different types of datas

Example ->

my_bag = 2
my_bag = 3.6
my_bag = "Big"
my_bag = ("12", "Big", 3.6)

these above code won't generate any error

to check the type of any variable -> type(variable_name)
