t = ('Amit', 9.23, 5) => immutable that means changing the values by t[2] = 10		// error

tuples have only two methods -> count and index

assignment simultaneously:

(a, b) = (4, 'yes')

(4, 6, 8) > (1, 3, 5)		// True => it checks from MSB, if for MSB the condition is true it won't go beyond
('amit', 'paul') < ('amit', 'kumar')	// False => as 'p' > 'k'
